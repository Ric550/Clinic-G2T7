    # - host="0.0.0.0" allows the flask program to accept requests sent from any IP/host (in addition to localhost),
    #   -- i.e., it gives permissions to hosts with any IP to access the flask program,
    #   -- as long as the hosts can already reach the machine running the flask program along the network;
    #   -- it doesn't mean to use http://0.0.0.0 to access the flask program.
